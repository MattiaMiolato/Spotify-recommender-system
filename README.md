# Spotify-recommender-system

This project was created in the context of an university assigment. The goal of our project is to build a recommender system from the Song Dataset provided by Spotify.

The dataset contains more than 160.000 songs collected from Spotify Web API, grouped by artist, year, or genre in the data section. The description of the features of the dataset can be found (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/) and (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-track/).
